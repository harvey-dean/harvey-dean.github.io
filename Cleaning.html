<h2><strong>Tips on how to make cleaning easier because let’s be honest, no one likes cleaning. </strong></h2>
<ol>
  <li>Clean as you go. This way, at the end you don’t have as much mess to clean up. Minimizing the amount of time, you have to spend cleaning. </li>
  <li>Clean up any spills you make ASAP. Make sure to clean up any spills you make as soon as you make them. Since the spill is still fresh, if you wait, the spill can dry up and make it harder for you to clean. It also eliminates the risk of any stains the spill may result in if its dry. </li>
  <li>Clean While you’re Waiting. If you clean while you wait for the food to cook, rise, proof etc, you will be passing time while waiting, and keeping your kitchen clean, ready and waiting for the food to be done. It’s much easier to keep organised if your workspace is organised. </li>
  <li>Clean dishes ASAP. Similar to the spills, dishes are cleaned easiest before the food dries on them. If you cook pasta in a pot, it can be a pain to clean the dried pasta off. So making sure to clean the dishes immediately after using them saves a lot of time and effort. </li>
